### Client Technology used💻
_The frontend has been developed without using any frameworks, just with javascript (vanilla style)._
_An express server was initiated to be able to serve the static content (in folder public) with more funcionalities like choosing the server PORT._ 
_Public folder contains: _
1) Some style assets like CSS, images... 
2) 3 HTML files (homepage for signup / login, menu page and chat page). 
3) 3 Javascript files (one for each HTML file) that contains the buttons, event-handlers, html-elements definition and using of session storage.
4) 2 helper javascript files (users and rooms) for the FETCH functions that manage the requests and the responses with the server. 
 
 ⚠️ FRONT IS NOT RESPONSIVE, SO THE CHAT CAN ONLY BE USED IN COMPUTER WITH FULL SCREEN ⚠️

### Server Technology used⚙️
_Express, HTTP and Socket server are class based. This provides a clean way to organize the chat._
_The database models are 3: message, room and user. This last one has two methods to generate authentification tokens and to find users in database._
_There are 6 endpoints defined clearly and separately in both routes and controllers folder: 1. POST /signup, 2. POST /login, 3. GET /user , 4. POST /rooms_ , 5. GET /rooms, 6. PATCH /rooms
_Authentification is based on Json Web Tokens_
